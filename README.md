## Working

The Brilliant Pro LMS works in two different modes for
Admins and Learners respectively.

• Learners are the end-users. These are the users for whom the
training content is designed. They are the recipients of the
training and access the LMS to view learning material and
participate in the course work and assessments, all while
tracking their own progress along the way.

• Administrators are in charge for the management of the LMS,
which includes multiple tasks ranging from course creation,
to learner assignment, to monitoring learner progress.
